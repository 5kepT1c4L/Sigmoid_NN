# Sigmoid_NN
## Overview
sigmoid_nn.py file consists of a neural network made from scratch. It uses the sigmoid function as the activation function and weight matrices are randomly produced/utilized. Calculus was used for back propagation and gradient descent.

tensorflow_m.py file consists of the same neural network but made with the tensorflow library this time. It also uses the sigmoid function as the activation function and MSE as the model's loss function.
